TawfiqA05: How many unique state values are used on this dataset?

with out importing any libraries making sure to use the whole data set

GitHub Copilot: To determine the number of unique state values in the dataset without importing any libraries, you can use a simple script that reads the file line by line, extracts the state values, and counts the unique ones. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. Open the file.
2. Read the file line by line.
3. Extract the state value from each line.
4. Store the state values in a set (since sets automatically handle uniqueness).
5. Count the number of unique state values.

Here's the code to achieve this:

```python
# Step 1: Open the file
with open('covid_data_set.csv', 'r') as file:
    # Step 2: Read the file line by line
    lines = file.readlines()

# Step 3: Initialize an empty set to store unique state values
unique_states = set()

# Step 4: Iterate over the lines, starting from the second line to skip the header
for line in lines[1:]:
    # Step 5: Split the line by commas and extract the state value (second column)
    state = line.split(',')[1]
    # Step 6: Add the state value to the set
    unique_states.add(state)

# Step 7: Count the number of unique state values
num_unique_states = len(unique_states)

# Print the result
print(f"Number of unique state values: {num_unique_states}")
```

This script will output the number of unique state values in the dataset.

TawfiqA05: incude one example of Repeated Execution

GitHub Copilot: To determine the number of unique state values in the dataset and include an example of repeated execution, you can use a simple script that reads the file line by line, extracts the state values, and counts the unique ones. Here's the code to achieve this:

```python
# Function to count unique state values
def count_unique_states(file_path):
    # Step 1: Open the file
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Step 2: Read the file line by line
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Step 3: Initialize an empty set to store unique state values
    unique_states = set()

    # Step 4: Iterate over the lines, starting from the second line to skip the header
    for line in lines[1:]:
        # Step 5: Split the line by commas and extract the state value (second column)
        state = line.split(',')[1]
        # Step 6: Add the state value to the set
        unique_states.add(state)

    # Step 7: Count the number of unique state values
    num_unique_states = len(unique_states)

    # Return the result
    return num_unique_states

# Example of repeated execution
file_path = 'covid_data_set.csv'
for _ in range(3):  # Repeated execution 3 times
    result = count_unique_states(file_path)
    print(f"Number of unique state values: {result}")
```

This script defines a function `count_unique_states` that takes a file path as an argument, reads the file, extracts unique state values, and returns the count. The repeated execution example runs this function three times and prints the result each time.

TawfiqA05: make sure its generalized to the whole data set provided

GitHub Copilot: To generalize the script to handle the entire dataset provided, you can follow the same steps as before but ensure the script reads the entire file and processes all lines. Here's the updated script:

```python
# Function to count unique state values
def count_unique_states(file_path):
    # Step 1: Open the file
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        # Step 2: Read the file line by line
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Step 3: Initialize an empty set to store unique state values
    unique_states = set()

    # Step 4: Iterate over the lines, starting from the second line to skip the header
    for line in lines[1:]:
        # Step 5: Split the line by commas and extract the state value (second column)
        state = line.split(',')[1]
        # Step 6: Add the state value to the set
        unique_states.add(state)

    # Step 7: Count the number of unique state values
    num_unique_states = len(unique_states)

    # Return the result
    return num_unique_states

# Example of repeated execution
file_path = 'covid_data_set.csv'
for _ in range(3):  # Repeated execution 3 times
    result = count_unique_states(file_path)
    print(f"Number of unique state values: {result}")
```

This script reads the entire dataset from the file `covid_data_set.csv`, processes all lines to extract unique state values, and prints the count of unique states three times to demonstrate repeated execution.
